“Peirce Interprets Peirce” is a collaborative digital humanities project dedicated to exploring the original manuscripts of Charles S. Peirce. By combining rigorous semiotic scholarship with state-of-the-art computational methods, we aim to make Peirce’s intellectual legacy more accessible, analyzable, and engaging for scholars and the wider public.

Our work focuses on three pillars:

- Digitization and high-quality transcription of manuscripts
- Computational analysis of texts and diagrams
- Open dissemination of results through accessible resources and events

#### Why Peirce, Why Now

Charles S. Peirce, a foundational thinker in semiotics, logic, and the philosophy of science, left a vast and intricate archive of manuscripts. Many remain underexplored due to their scope and complexity. Today’s advances in OCR/HTR, NLP, and knowledge graph technologies offer a timely opportunity to revisit this archive and reveal new insights into Peirce’s concepts—such as icons, indexes, symbols, and the universal categories of Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness.

#### Objectives

- Build a curated, high-fidelity digital corpus of Peirce’s manuscripts.
- Analyze linguistic, conceptual, and diagrammatic patterns using AI-driven methods.
- Model and connect knowledge through interoperable standards (e.g., TEI-XML, Linked Data).
- Share findings widely via open data, publications, and public-facing resources.

#### Approach and Methods (in plain language)

- Transcription and Curation: We apply advanced OCR and Handwritten Text Recognition to produce accurate digital texts, then enrich them with metadata and annotations.
- Computational Analysis: We use Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models to detect themes, stylistic features, and semiotic structures, and to study the role of diagrams in Peirce’s reasoning.
- Knowledge Organization: We structure insights in a knowledge graph based on cultural heritage standards, enabling cross-references between documents, concepts, people, and places.
- Visualization: We design clear, interactive visual summaries to help audiences explore the archive through thematic pathways and conceptual maps.

#### Impact

- Scientific: New perspectives on Peirce’s oeuvre, connecting semiotics and cultural analytics; reusable datasets and methods for future research.
- Pedagogical: Teaching resources and reproducible workflows that foster critical digital literacy.
- Openness: Commitment to FAIR principles and open access for data, code, and documentation wherever possible.
