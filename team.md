### Global Collaboration for Groundbreaking Research

Our project is a testament to international academic partnership, bringing together leading institutions to push the boundaries of digital scholarship:

- **University of Lausanne (UNIL):** Leading the charge in text analytics and AI applications.
- **RWTH Aachen University:** Driving the integration of semiotic theory and advanced visualization.
- **Bibliotheca Hertziana – Max Planck Institute for Art History (BHMPI):** Architecting the knowledge organization and digital infrastructure.
- **University of Groningen (RUG):** Contributing specialized expertise in network visualization.
- **metaLAB (Harvard University):** Providing strategic guidance on data acquisition and global outreach.

This collaborative ecosystem ensures a comprehensive and innovative approach to Peirce's vast intellectual output.
